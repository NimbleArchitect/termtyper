# termtyper

An autotyping assistant 

## Features
full keyboard control, so you never have to reach for the mouse

## How it works
press your selected keyboard combination to open termtyper, search for your selected command using the arrow keys to navigate press enter to select the command and enter again to type the command into your active window

## Why?
I have way too many terminal commands to remember and I got fed up with using a text editor to remember all the commands.

## Getting Started
termtype dosent have any commands stored by default so you will have to add them yourself to do so open the app and click on the new button (ctl + n)
